Create an excel sheet for student identification details.
create an images folder for student image data with this the comparison is done between the students and  identify the person while using a mobile in restricted area.


Implementing a system for mobile phone detection in restricted areas using YOLOv8 is a significant step 
towards enhancing security and enforcing regulations. By integrating computer vision technology with 
YOLOv8, we can accurately identify mobile phones in restricted zones, thereby preventing unauthorized 
usage and mitigating potential security risks. Furthermore, automating the process of sending email 
notifications to the relevant authorities using SMTP and MIME ensures prompt action can be taken upon 
detection. The inclusion of image proof enhances the credibility of the notifications, providing authorities 
with tangible evidence to support their decision-making process.
